SOC Analyst home lab using SPLUNK to analyze Windows Event Logs
# SOC Analyst Home Lab – Splunk SIEM

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a SOC Analyst home lab using Splunk Enterprise to analyse Windows Event Logs. 
The objective was to simulate real-world SOC activities such as log ingestion, event analysis, and 
security trend identification.

## Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise (Free)
- Windows Event Logs
- CSV log ingestion
- SPL (Search Processing Language)

## What I Did
- Installed and configured Splunk Enterprise locally
- Ingested Windows Event Log data into Splunk
- Parsed and analysed Information, Warning, and Error events
- Investigated system and security-related errors
- Performed time-based trend analysis to identify abnormal behaviour
- Conducted manual threat hunting using SPL searches

## Key Findings
- Identified recurring system and security service errors
- Observed spikes in error events during specific time periods
- Confirmed absence of failed login attempts in the dataset, demonstrating baseline behaviour analysis

## Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM fundamentals (Splunk)
- Log ingestion and parsing
- Windows Event Log analysis
- Security monitoring and investigation
- Threat hunting basics
- Analytical and investigative thinking
